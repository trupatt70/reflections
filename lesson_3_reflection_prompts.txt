When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you are working with other developers or using a different local computer. Also it
  is a good way to have a backup incase something happens to your local computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  This way you have latitude as to what you want to push or pull from GitHub. Not all files
  on your local computer are ready to commit or you want to commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  A fork is only used when cloning a repository on GitHub. Cloning is coping repositories
  from one computer to another or directly from GitHub to a local computer. Branching is adding another
  commit changes separate from the master head to a project.
