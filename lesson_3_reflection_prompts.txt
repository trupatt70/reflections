When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you are working with other developers or using a different local computer. Also it
  is a good way to have a backup incase something happens to your local computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  This way you have latitude as to what you want to push or pull from GitHub. Not all files
  on your local computer are ready to commit or you want to commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  A fork is only used when cloning a repository on GitHub. Cloning is coping repositories
  from one computer to another or directly from GitHub to a local computer. Branching is adding another
  commit changes separate from the master head to a project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  It allows you to add changes to the lasted commit or copy of the project your working on.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  Without GitHub or some form of version control, more supervision would be required to incorporate changes
  as well as more time to complete a project. With a version control tool, team members can work independantly
  without worrying about breaking the project.
