How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It simplifies the process of having to review the entire doc by
    only displaying the differences between the documents.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By allowing you to revert back to earlier editions instead of starting from
    scratch, thus saving time

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros to manually saving allows you the opportunity to save when
    logical changes with a clear purposes are made instead of randomly
    which cuts down on redundancy.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is for coding, in most cases you will have multiple file dependencies,
    where docs are independent files.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log list all the commits in the file, so you can determine what commits
    to compare using git diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It makes it easier to locate errors and cuts down on time spent rewriting code
    while guessing what's causing the problem.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use it for all my projects!
